# Webpack-React starter template

My startup environment for practice in React development. Built with Webpack 5.

## How to use

1. Clone template content into the current folder and remove unnecessary files with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/ilovesg/starter-template .; rm -rf trunk readme.md .git dist` or [download it manually](https://github.com/ilovesg/webpack-react-template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`;
3. Run: `npm start`.
